If they do, they are treated as having an Acuity of 19 (if your team is Phase 2, this Acuity increases to 22) for that check. In addition, once per mission, as an action, a team member may have the drone strike at the enemy. They may do this, even if they do not have line of sight to the enemy, as long as the enemy is not Hidden. The strike is a Combat stat check (+19) and deals 5D6 damage on a successful attack."),
